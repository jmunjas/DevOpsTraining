## DevSecOps 101

### What is DevSecOps

DevSecOps is an organizational software engineering culture and practice that aims at unifying software development (Dev), security (Sec) and operations (Ops). 

The main characteristic of DevSecOps is to automate, monitor, and apply security at all phases of the software lifecycle: 
- plan 
- develop
- build 
- test 
- release 
- deliver 
- deploy
- operate
- monitor

In DevSecOps, testing and security are shifted to the left through automated unit, functional, integration, and security testing. This is a key DevSecOps differentiator since security and functional capabilities are tested and built simultaneously.

DevSecOps provides demonstrable quality and security improvements over the traditional software lifecycle, which can be measured with these metrics:
- Mean-time to production: the average time it takes from when new software features are required until they are running in production.
- Average lead-time: how long it takes for a new requirement to be delivered and deployed.
- Deployment speed: how fast a new version of the application can be deployed into the production environment.
- Deployment frequency: how often a new release can be deployed into the production environment.
- Production failure rate: how often software fails during production.
- Mean-time to recovery: how long it takes applications in the production stage to recover from failure.

In addition, DevSecOps practice enables:
- Fully automated risk characterization, monitoring, and mitigation across the application lifecycle.
- Software updates and patching at a pace that allows the addressing of security vulnerabilities and code weaknesses.

### The benefits of adopting DevSecOps include:
- Reduced mean-time to production: the average time it takes from when new software features are required until they are running in production;
- Increased deployment frequency: how often a new release can be deployed into the production environment;
- Fully automated risk characterization, monitoring, and mitigation across the application lifecycle;
- Software updates and patching at "the speed of operations".
