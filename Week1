## Week One DevSecOps

### DevOps 101

DevSecOps is an organizational software engineering culture and practice that aims at unifying software development (Dev), security (Sec) and operations (Ops). 

The main characteristic of DevSecOps is to automate, monitor, and apply security at all phases of the software lifecycle: 
-plan 
-develop
-build 
-test 
-release 
-deliver 
-deploy
-operate
-monitor

In DevSecOps, testing and security are shifted to the left through automated unit, functional, integration, and security testing 
- this is a key DevSecOps differentiator since security and functional capabilities are tested and built simultaneously.
